I dont think i did anything to this one, other then pull it from the Retropie forums. The FPS is not the best but with changing the settings a little it can be played
There is a issue with the XINIT not shutting down once you quit the game. so you will need a way to kill the prosses 
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Exarkuniv/Devilutionx-RPI/Master/devilutionx.sh -P $HOME/RetroPie-Setup/scriptmodules/ports/
```
